# Contributing guideline

## The basics

We use the [Laravel framework](https://laravel.com/docs/6.x/), to learn more about it, read the basics section of its documentation.
It's also good to check out the previous commits, to see how to implement that part or that. Might seem a lot first, but it's really easy,
thanks to Laravel.

## Development

### Universal (using VS Code dev containers  - recommended)

 1. Clone Mars: `git clone git@github.com:EotvosCollegium/mars.git`.
 2. Install [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/) and run `composer install` in the project directory.
 3. You need to install Docker (and WSL2 on Windows). See [requirements here](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/containers#_system-requirements).
 4. You need to install VS code
 5. You need to install the Remote Development extension pack in VS code.
 6. Open the project in VS code. Copy the `.env.example` file to `.env` and run `php artisan key:generate`. Set `DB_HOST` to `mysql` in `.env` file.
 8. VS code should notice that the project is configured to use dev containers and will promt you if you want to use it. Click yes, and you're all done!


### OS X
For OS X, [Valet](https://laravel.com/docs/6.x/valet) gives a pretty smooth experience. Easy to download, easy to configure.

### Windows and Linux

For Windows and Linux the project has an example [Laravel Homestead](https://laravel.com/docs/homestead) configuration which can be used for local development.

With these steps you should be able to run Mars on your machine:

1. Clone Mars: `git clone git@github.com:EotvosCollegium/mars.git`.
2. Install [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/) and [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/). (Or other virtualization platforms supported by Vagrant. Don't forget to reconfigure the `provider` in the steps below if you do so.)
3. Follow the instructions in the [First steps](https://laravel.com/docs/8.x/homestead#first-steps) section:
    - `vagrant box add laravel/homestead`
    - `git clone https://github.com/laravel/homestead.git` from a folder where you want to set up Homestead
    - go into this new directory
    - `git checkout release`
    - `init.bat` (`bash init.sh` on Linux)
4. Set up Homestead: Copy and rename `Homestead.yaml.example` from this repository to `Homestead.yaml` in the Homestead directory (overwrite if needed). Modify this file by changing `folders: - map: /your/local/path/to/mars` .
5. Create ssh keys to `~/.ssh/homestead_rsa.pub` and `~/.ssh/homestead_rsa`. (You can use something like `ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "your_email@example.com"`.)
6. On Windows add the `192.168.10.10 mars.local` host entry to `C:\Windows\System32\drivers\etc\hosts`.
7. Go to your Homestead directory and Run `vagrant up` and `vagrant ssh` to set up and enter your virtual machine.
8. In the project root (`cd mars`) run `composer install`
9. Set up Mars: Copy and rename `.env.example` to `.env`, and change these settings:
   `DB_DATABASE=homestead DB_USERNAME=homestead DB_PASSWORD=secret APP_URL=http://mars.local`.
10. Run the following commands:

-   Run `php artisan migrate:fresh --seed`.
-   Run `php artisan key:generate`.
-   Run `npm install` to install JS related dependencies.
-   Run `npm run dev` to create the CSS and JS files in the `public` directory.

11. The project should be running at [mars.local](http://mars.local/).

### Optional steps

-   You can add your personal access token from GitHub to use the GitHub API (eg. bug reports are sent through this). [You can generate a token here.](https://github.com/settings/tokens) You have to check the 'public_repo' scope.
-   If you want to test emails, change `MAIL_TEST_ADMIN` to your email (after seeding, you will be able to log in to the admin user with this email address) and set your email credentials (`MAIL_USERNAME` and `MAIL_PASSWORD`) - you might have to enable third party access to your email account.
-  If you are working with uploaded files, run `php artisan storage:link` to make the uploads available by their paths in the url.

### For everyday use

Most of the above setup is a one-time thing to do. However, whenever you start working on based on a newer version, you will have to run the following commands:

-   `npm run dev`: In case of recent UI changes (ie. JS or CSS), this will generate the new assets from `webpack.mix.js`. For frontend developers, `npm watch` might be useful -- it does the same, but also updates on change.
-   `php artisan migrate:fresh --seed`: This will migrate everything from scratch (useful if you work on changes in parallel) and seeds the database.

You can log in to our seeded admin user with email `MAIL_TEST_ADMIN` (`example@eotvos.elte.hu` by default - you can find this in your .env file) and with password `asdasdasd`. See `database/seeds/UsersTableSeeder.php` for more predefined users.

## Alternative: running Docker from terminal with Sail

This method is known to work under Linux (Ubuntu 20.04, to be precise). Maybe it also works with WSL2.

The steps:
1. Follow the points under "Universal" until step 3 ([here are Docker installation instructions](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/ubuntu/)).
2. Add your user to the `docker` group: `sudo groupadd docker && sudo usermod -aG docker $USER`. This will ensure you can manage Docker without `sudo` later. (Note: this might be a bit unsafe. But this is the way it worked for me.)
3. In `.env`, update `APP_URL` to `http://localhost:8080`.
4. Add these lines:

```
APP_PORT=8080
FORWARD_DB_PORT=33066
```

5. Still in `.env`, rewrite `DB_HOST` from the given IP to `mysql`.
6. Run `./vendor/bin/sail up`.
7. Open another terminal. Before seeding, add the correct privilege to the user `collegiumnostrum` in MySQL:
    - Run `docker exec -it collegiumnostrum-mysql-1 bash`. This way, you'll log into the container as root.
    - Run `mysql --password` with the password given in `.env`.
    - Say `SET GLOBAL log_bin_trust_function_creators = 1;`.
    - Exit.
8. Run `./vendor/bin/sail artisan migrate:fresh --seed`. (Other Artisan commands need to be executed similarly.)
9. Now you can test the site at `http://localhost:8080`.
10. Instead of SSH, you can use `docker exec -it mars-laravel.test-1 bash`.
11. And to access MySQL, run `docker exec -it mars-mysql-1 mysql --user=mars --password mars` (change the container name, the username and the database name if needed; the latter two are in .env) and log in with the password (also found in .env).

## Keep it minimal

The main problem with Ur√°n 1.1 was its _reinventing the wheel_ strategy. Laravel provides everything we need. Use it.
The other problem was the unnecessary features came before the most important ones. Therefore the now defined issues are minimal, only
contain the necessary parts of the system. After these are done, we can change the world. But first, build it.

## Commiting

When you would like to make some change, assign an issue to yourself, only after that start working on it.
If there's no issue, create one, but remember the paragraph above. Keep it minimal. If something's not clear, ask your questions under the issue.
Feel free to create your own branch (if you are a contributor), or fork the repo.
When you are done with your changes, the commit message should be the Issue's title and it should be sent through a
Pull Request. Also, feel free to review already sent in changes. E.g.

```bash
# when you start working
git checkout masteryour_feature_branch
git pull
git checkout -b your_feature_branch

# add your changes

# when you are done
git add --all  # or only your changes
git commit # an editor comes up, the first line should look like: Issue #x: changed this and that
# add more information if needed
git fetch origin
git rebase origin/master # resolve conflicts if something comes up
git push origin your_feature_branch

# open repo in your browser and you should see a Create PR option.
```
