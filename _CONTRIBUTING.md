## Simple git usage

```bash
# when you start working
git checkout master
git pull
git checkout -b your_feature_branch

# add your changes

# when you are done
git add --all  # or only your changes
git commit # an editor comes up, the first line should look like: Issue #x: changed this and that
# add more information if needed
git fetch origin
git rebase origin/master # resolve conflicts if something comes up
git push origin your_feature_branch

# open repo in your browser and you should see a Create PR option.
```
