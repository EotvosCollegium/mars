## Contributions

Contributions are welcome from both developers and other volunteers. If you are a developer, checkout our
[Contribution guidlines](_CONTRIBUTING.md) to get started.
If not, the easiest thing right now is catching up with our language files. You can find them
[here](resources/lang). Each folder contains translations a specific
language, where in each file we assign the proper words/sentences to the keys we use in the code.
